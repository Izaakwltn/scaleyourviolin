   <p>I offer violin, viola, and mandolin lessons virtually and in person in the 
    Denver Area.
   <p>For the past 7 years I have taught students on all three instruments in both 
    Denver and the Atlanta area, and I am passionate about tailoring a personalized 
    approach to technique, focus practice, and musical expression for each 
    individual student.
   <p>I teach and have taught all ages and levels of students, and am just as 
    passionate about creating a stable and enjoyable foundation for beginners as I 
    am helping advanced students polish their most dazzling piece yet.
   <hr>
   <p>Virtual lessons are taught on Zoom, FaceTime, and Google Hangouts, and I'm 
    always open to trying your preferred video-call service!
   <h5>Please reach out with any questions or queries, or to set up your first 
    lesson!</h5>
