   <h3>Izaak Walton</h3>
   <p>Hello! I'm Izaak, a violinist and teacher of violin, viola, and mandolin based 
    out of Denver, CO.

   <p>As a teacher, I am particularly passionate about helping students find the 
    best sound on their instrument, both through technical setup, ear training, and 
    musical development. Finding a strong, focused sound as a foundation for their 
    further studies can, and will, carry the student far into their musical 
    explorations!
   <p> I received my Bachelors in Violin Performance from the University of Georgia, 
    studying with Levon Ambartsumian, Shakhida Azimkodjaeva, and Dr. Michael Heald, 
    in addition to Raymond Leung of the Atlanta Symphony. In 2017 I moved out here 
    to Denver, receiving my Masters in Violin Performance with Dr. Linda Wang at the 
    University of Denver.
